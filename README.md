# A/B Test for Gym Members

This project is based on a capstone project in the Data Analyst course on Codecademy. The goal of this project is to compare the difference between Group A (people who were given the fitness test with a personal trainer) and Group B (people who were not given the fitness test) at each state of the process:

* Percent of visitors who apply.
* Percent of applicants who purchase a membership.
* Percent of all visitors who purchase a membership.
